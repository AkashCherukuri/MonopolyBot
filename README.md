# MonopolyBot
Written in `Python 3.7`.
**Will not work in `Python2` as f-strings have been implemented.**

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey in creating a bot to play Monopoly well. All the new practices that I've incorporated, and everything new that I've learnt will be shown here, to make looking back on my shortcomings easier.

## Rules of the Game
I've decided to follow the standard rules of Monopoly, and no "party rules" have been included. Any changes made to the rules for convenience will be listed below.
### Changes to the rules
None So Far. Expect to see some here as the project proceeds.
### Source(s)
The Rules have been taken from the Official Rules Site from [FANDOM](https://monopoly.fandom.com/wiki/Official_Rules).

## My Plan for this project
1. Make a Basic "Command Line" version of the game, for starters
2. Create a Naive AI, after getting to know all the intricate strategies in the game
3. Once satisfactory, create a RL Bot (Planning on Q-Learning for present, might change later)
4. Check effectiveness of the RLBot after training against Naive AI
5. Add Graphical Interface to the Board to make it more visually appealing (Highly Unlikey that I will do this, maybe long term?)

## Skills Procured / What I've learnt
- Using Git directly from Visual Studio. (Yeah pretty basic, ik. We all had to start from somewhere)
- Importance and usage of `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`. (Read above text in parantheses again)
- ***How bad Windows is for code development.*** Like, using Ubuntu is so much simpler. Why do I do this to myself?
- **Importance of Comments.** Comment whenever you get an idea OR explain part of a code/fucntion in brief. You'll thank yourself later.
